# Meetups 101

This repository is a collection of rules on how to run a good meetup. Its meant to be used as a checklist of sorts, running through all possible items in terms of organising, marketing and executing the meetup on the day. This is being maintained by a group of community leaders based in Karachi, Pakistan who are usually doing meetups every now and then.
