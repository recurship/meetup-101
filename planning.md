- Marketing (website, FB/Twitter, FB Event)
- Speakers
- Gifts of Speakers and Attendees
- Selling tickets


### Venue

This can be one of the trickiest ones or easiest one to get done depending on how well you are connected in the community. In Karachi, there are many spaces which one can reach out to for sponsered venue, these are usually either community spaces (like NestIO and DotZero), or universities. Sometimes you can also do it at an office space if its big enough, usually some offices have some training room which seats about 50-80 people which can come in handy.

#### Sizing the venue

Normally you decide the number of people you would like to have in your meetup and then select the venue. Sometimes its the venue you get that forms this restriction. Then there will be times where your registrations completely go wild and you rack a few hundred of them. Easiest policy is first come first serve, notifying the participants well before the event.

### Sponsership

You dont really need sponsership for a meetup. Essentially you need 3 things, a sponsered venue, volenteers speakers and one or two volenteer to help run the meetup. If you want to do some snacks, in Karachi you need about PKR 4000 - 5000 (USD 30) to cater tea and snacks for about 50 people. This is a fairly minimal amount which can be usually sponsered by a single company. If you have sponsership and are looking for splurge, some options include a fancy venue, proper lunch, give away goodies, shields for speakers, honorium for speakers, and camera / video.
